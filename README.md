# clone_bheh_tools_v1

Clone Some BHEH Fav Tools used in our daily training, pentesting.
Ranging from offensive scripts, reconnaissance, reporting, DDoS, Forensics & more.

The future of this script, as we are working on it, is to automate the installation of 
all the cloned gits of some of our favorite most used tools, update your machine, using
a separate script that we have, by integrating it to this one, and eventually add to it
till it becomes an all in one tool, generating a report of the tools this script has installed
listing them eventually in categories.

*This is for educational purpose and testing only! Do not attempt using those if you do not have
